In our closed circuit recirculating aquaculture system, the culture water is purified and reused continuously. The produced waste products; solid waste, ammonium and CO2, are either removed or converted into non-toxic products by the system components. The purified water is subsequently saturated with oxygen and then returned to the fish tanks."
